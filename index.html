        <h3>A bit about me...</h3>
        <p class="aboutMe-p">Formerly working in housing and estate regeneration, 
            my interest in software engineering began when working as the lead 
            user during CRM development and user testing at a housing association, 
            Newlon Housing Trust. This was my opportunity to see how things worked 
            behind the scenes for the first time and be part of improving the 
            experience of the user. A short course with Code First: Girls and now
            the Software Engineering Immersive at General Assembly have taught 
            me the skills which will enable a strong start to my career in software 
            development. Qualities including being resourceful and thorough, and 
            enjoying seeing the results of hard work, make me a dedicated and 
            enthusiastic team member. I am looking for a role which combines my 
            passion for continuous learning and skill development with the 
            opportunity to work alongside diverse individuals with varying knowledge 
            to achieve high quality results. </p>
        <p class="aboutMe-p">
            When I’m not at work, I can often be found reading a book in a corner, 
            ahead of my next book club meeting. If I'm not there, I’ll have a pint 
            of ale in my hand or cooking something up in the kitchen.
